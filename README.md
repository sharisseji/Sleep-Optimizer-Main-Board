# Sleep-Optimizer-Main-Board

This project uses two STM32 Microcontrollers to manually control and reset light and sound settings on a breadboard. This board receives the USART signal from Board A to change the output of the LEDs and buzzer connected to it.

Board A Code can be found [here](https://github.com/sharisseji/Sleep-Optimizer-Board-A.git).

The board type we used was the STM32 NUCLEO F4O1RE for both microctontrollers. The microcontrollers were programmed using STM32CubeIDE.
